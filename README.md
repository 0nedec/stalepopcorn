Stalepopcorn Project

The stalepopcorn project was a final project for a Database Interfaces and Programming class.
As the title suggests the class was an introduction to Interfacing to database via the web.
Primarily using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) software architechture pattern.

The website iteslf is simple, the idea was to create a front end for a local movie theater.
The website displays current movies showing (all information taken from a DB), letting the user
select a movie, followed by a showtime. This then took the user to a checkout page where they could purchase tickets.
In the checkout paage the user could also pick items from the concession stand to add to their purchase of tickets.
All information was contained in a MySQL database, we used a Tomcat server, for serving the pages.
